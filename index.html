            <h3>Goal of the Game:</h3>
            <li>
              The primary objective in Blackjack is to beat the dealer without
              exceeding 21.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Card Values:</h3>
            <li>
              This game is played with a standard deck of playing cards (52
              cards in total).
            </li>
            <li>Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.</li>
            <li>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.</li>
            <li>
              Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value
              benefits the player more.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Player Actions:</h3>
            <li>
              Hit: The player can request additional cards to try and improve
              their hand. They can continue to hit as many times as they wish,
              but if the total exceeds 21, they lose the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stand: If the player is satisfied with their current hand, they
              can choose to "stand," which means they don't take any more cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deal: After the game is over, the player can start a new game.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Dealer Actions:</h3>
            <li>The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Winning and Payouts:</h3>
            <li>
              Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) usually pays out at higher
              odds (player's bet returned with an extra of 1.5 times their bet).
            </li>
            <li>
              If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without
              going over, the player wins (player's bet returned with an extra
              of 1 times their bet).
            </li>
            <li>
              If both the player and dealer have the same total, it's a tie, and
              the player's bet is returned.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the player's without
              going over, the player loses (player's bet is lost).
            </li>
          </ul>
